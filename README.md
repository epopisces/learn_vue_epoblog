The 5th iteration on this, perhaps, as I explore technologies.  My requirements:
* markdown into blog posts
* mermaid support
* Vue 3 if at all possible

The path that has led me here included:

Vue 3
* started here because it is what I built my website in, but decided I wanted to try and use a more blog-oriented framework that might have a little more out of the box
Vue 2 + Gridsome
* really nice framework. Unfortunately seemed abandoned with a large number of vulnerable dependencies, and didn't support Vue 3 nor had any signs of doing so
Vitepress
* very new, seems like a really cool project but the documentation simply isn't there for someone who is not already a Vue expert
VuePress Next
Nuxt
Vue 3 again
* well for heaven sake's let's just roll our own on top of Vue 3!  If I'm going to have to invest the time would rather learn a capable, cutting edge framework with a wide range of possibilities at the same time
