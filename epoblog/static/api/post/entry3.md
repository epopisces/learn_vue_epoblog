And depending on what your end goal is, this could be a fairly simple process!  Or a fairly extended one.  Let's dig a bit deeper into what the options are.

### Photos to LEGO Mosaics to Instructions

This is the simplest route.  Want to convert that family photo into a LEGO keepsake, and have a ton of 1x1 bricks or [<u>Dots</u>](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/big-message-board-41952) lying around?  This may be a good option for you!

The steps involved are fairly simple:
1. Capture an image
2. Convert the image to 1x1 LEGO bricks (which act as 'pixels') using software such as [LEGO's Mosaic Maker](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mosaic-maker)

For an in depth guide, see Converting Pictures to a LEGO Mosaic (WIP).

### Photos to 3D Models to LEGO Bricks to Instructions

This is a multi-step process, and there is no silver bullet.  Results will vary from one method and app to another.

Essentially what this entails is using [<u>*Photogrammetry*</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) to generate a three dimensional object from a 2D image (or using *Stereophotogrammetry*, which is the same process but with two or more photos)

In brief, here are the different steps involved:
1. Capture one or more images (the method used can have a big impact on the quality of the results!)
2. Convert those image(s) to a 3d model or 'object' using software
    - (optionally) clean up the 3d object
3. Convert the 3d model to a LEGO instruction set using software (usually different software from the one used in step 2)

Because of the detail involved (and the fact that steps 1 and 2 have uses beyond LEGOs) the guide to perform this process has been split into two parts:
