## Views

Within this folder are components that act as views for routing purposes.  See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50865828/what-is-the-difference-between-the-views-and-components-folders-in-a-vue-project) for the difference between the two.

Any component in this folder should be built with the intent of being the target of one or more routes.

Note there is no technical requirement for the `views/` folder to exist: it could easily be merged with `components/`.  However in a potentially sprawling project it can help with administration.
